# Introduction
This lab focuses on two key ways to test software: Mutation Testing and Automated GUI/Web Testing. We work on the same test suite as assignment 3 and try to enhance the tests. In the first part, we use Pitest to check and improve test sets for the Range and DataUtilities classes. We look at mutation scores to see how good the tests are and make the tests better to cover more ground. We follow various techniques to increase the score. We try to write tests that check a varied range of inputs. We analyze mutants that are killed by the original test suite from assignment 3, and also observe the mutants that are not killed. The second part is about automated UI testing. Here, we use Selenium IDE to write and run test scripts that check if a web app works correctly. The website that we focus on is GAP Canada: https://www.gapcanada.ca/. We check various features of this website and generate scripts to carry out automated testing. We also compare Selenium with Sikulix, pointing out what makes them good at testing GUI. The goal of this lab is to learn more about software testing by improving test sets with mutation testing and using automated tools to make web testing faster and more reliable.

# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class 

# Report all the statistics and the mutation score for each test class



# Analysis drawn on the effectiveness of each of the test classes

# A discussion on the effect of equivalent mutants on mutation score accuracy

# A discussion of what could have been done to improve the mutation score of the test suites

# Why do we need mutation testing? Advantages and disadvantages of mutation testing

# Explain your SELENUIM test case design process

# Explain the use of assertions and checkpoints

# how did you test each functionaity with different test data

# Discuss advantages and disadvantages of Selenium vs. Sikulix

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed


# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

# Comments/feedback on the lab itself
